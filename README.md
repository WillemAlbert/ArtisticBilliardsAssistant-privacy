Privacy policy for the iOS App Artistic Billiards Assistant

The app is sold through the Apple App Store

I can only see how many people buy the app, not who they are.

The app does not send any data to me.

You can send me an email from within the app if you want, click the @ on the main screen and your email client will be launched.
